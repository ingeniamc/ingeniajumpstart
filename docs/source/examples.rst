This page contains guides that outline examples of how to extend the existing code with new functionality.

It is meant to be a starting point for developing your own application that has all the features you need.

Changing the value of a register
================================

One of the main functions of the program is that it allows you to communicate with the drive using the ingenialink library.

The objective of this example is changing the value of a register of the drive upon changing the content of an input box in the GUI.

#.  Add the input box to the frontend::

        SpinBox {
            (component properties)
            onValueModified: () => {
                grid.driveController.set_register_max_velocity(value, Enums.Drive.Left);
            }
        }

    As we can see, the box defines a handler that triggers when the value changes. We use it to call a function of driveController.
    However, in order for this to work, we need the driveController to be accessible in the frontend.

#.  Add the driveController as a property in our **main.qml**::

        ApplicationWindow {
            id: page
            title: qsTr("K2 Base Camp")
            required property DriveController driveController
            ...        
        }

#.  Making a controller accessible in qml happens in **__main__.py**::

        ...
        qml_file = os.fspath(Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "views/main.qml")
        engine = QQmlApplicationEngine()

        drive_controller = DriveController()
        engine.setInitialProperties({"driveController": drive_controller})

        engine.load(qml_file)
        ...

#.  If the SpinBox is a direct child component of **main.qml**, we can continue with the next step. However, since we have separated our code over several pages, we need to pass the driveController to the ControlsPage, which holds the SpinBox::

        ApplicationWindow {
            ...

            ControlsPage {
                id: controlsPage
                driveController: page.driveController
            }
        }

#.  Now we can implement the function in the DriveController::

        @Slot(float, int)
        def set_register_max_velocity(self, max_velocity: float, drive: int) -> None:
            self.mcs.run(
                self.log_report,
                "communication.set_register",
                "CL_VEL_REF_MAX",
                max_velocity,
                Drive(drive).name,
            )

    Note the @Slot-decorator - it is necessary for the function to be callable from the GUI and defines the types of the parameters it expects.
    We are making use of the MotionControllerService here, calling its "run" function with several parameters. 
    This is the most basic way to communicate with the drive and allows us to directly invoke a single ingenialink - function.
    That function (in this case *communication.set_register*) will be executed **in a seperate thread** with all parameters that come after it (*max_velocity, Drive(drive).name*).
    Upon conclusion, the callback function (*self.log_report*) will be invoked.
    The thread we use to communicate with the drive is an instance of MotionControllerThread, which was created when MotionControllerService was instantiated.

#.  The callback function can be used to update the frontend with data returned from the thread (it is passed to the callback as a *thread_report*). However, in this case we simply log the result to the console::

        def log_report(self, report: thread_report) -> None:
            logger.debug(report)


More complex communication with the drive
=========================================

Oftentimes, calling a single ingenialink - function is not enough. 
For example, when enabling the motor, we need to set the operation mode before calling the motor_enable function.
MotionControllerService provides the @run_on_thread - utility decorator for these use cases. 
Essentially, it allows us to define a function that is passed in its entirety to the MotionControllerThread and executed there "in one go".

We will assume that the controller we want to use is already connected to qml (see previous example for details).

#.  Define a checkbox to enable the motor in the GUI::

        CheckBox {
            id: motorEnable
            text: qsTr("Enable motor")
            onToggled: () => {
                if (motorEnable.checked) {
                    grid.driveController.enable_motor(Enums.Drive.Left);
                } else {
                    ...
                }
            }
        }

#.  In the driveController, define the corresponding function::

        @Slot(int)
        def enable_motor(self, drive: int) -> None:
            target = Drive(drive)
            if target == Drive.Left:
                self.mcs.enable_motor(self.enable_motor_l_callback, target)
            else:
                self.mcs.enable_motor(self.enable_motor_r_callback, target)

#.  As we can see, this time we call a custom function in the MotionControllerService. We need to write it ourselves::

        @run_on_thread
        def enable_motor(
            self,
            report_callback: Callable[[thread_report], Any],
            drive: Drive,
            *args: Any,
            **kwargs: Any,
        ) -> Callable[..., Any]:
            def on_thread(drive: Drive) -> Any:
                self.__mc.motion.set_operation_mode(
                    OperationMode.PROFILE_VELOCITY, servo=drive.name
                )
                self.__mc.motion.motor_enable(servo=drive.name)

            return on_thread

    Note that the @run_on_thread - decorator needs to be included in the function header.

    .. WARNING::
        
        Everything except the *drive: Drive* argument of both functions (*enable_motor* and *on_thread*), as well as the content of the *on_thread* - function is boilerplate.

Polling
=======

Since we just enabled a motor, we might want to continuosly monitor one of the drives registers (in this case the current motor velocity).
Looking at the previous example, we might notice that the driveController indicated a callback function to be executed when the MotionControllerThread finished its task.

#.  Let's use this callback function to start an instance of PollerThread to carry out the monitoring task::

        def enable_motor_l_callback(self, thread_report: thread_report) -> None:
            poller_thread = self.mcs.create_poller_thread(
                Drive.Left.name, [{"name": "CL_VEL_FBK_VALUE", "axis": 1}]
            )
            poller_thread.new_data_available_triggered.connect(
                self.handle_new_velocity_data_l
            )
            poller_thread.start()

    The actual creation of the new thread is handled in the MotionControllerService (see the *create_poller_thread* - function for details), but the important thing to highlight here is the following line::

        poller_thread.new_data_available_triggered.connect(
                self.handle_new_velocity_data_l
            )

#.  PollerThread defines a signal (*new_data_available_triggered*) which will emit when it receives new data from the drive. With the code above, we connect this signal to a function defined in DriveController::

        @Slot()
        def handle_new_velocity_data_l(
            self, timestamps: list[float], data: list[list[float]]
        ) -> None:
            self.velocity_left_changed.emit(timestamps[0], data[0][0])

    The function by itself does not do too much (it refactors the incoming data), but crucially it triggers the *velocity_left_changed* - signal (also defined in DriveController) to emit the data that was received (Drive -> PollerThread -> DriveController).

#.  Signals coming from a controller can be received in the GUI, which allows us to plot the data there::

        RowLayout {
            id: grid
            required property DriveController driveController

            Connections {
                target: grid.driveController
                function onVelocity_left_changed(timestamp, velocity) {
                    PlotJS.updatePlot(chartL, timestamp, velocity);
                }
                (more signal handlers..)
        }
    
    The driveController property is the same as outlined in the first example. 
    The important part to look at here is the *Connections* - component.
    It defines a target to connect to - this is where signals are coming from.
    It then defines handlers that will trigger when a specific signal is emitted.
    The name of the function corresponds to the signal we wish to react to, prefixed with an "on" (*onVelocity_left_changed* fires when *velocity_left_changed* emits).
    We now have the data available in the GUI and can draw a plot (refer to the *updatePlot* - javascript function for details).
